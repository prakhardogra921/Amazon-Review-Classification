Install the following packages:
sklearn
nltk

To run the KNN algorithm, directly run the "main.py" file

"test.py" and "create_bag_of_words.py" are the files that were used during my approach to implement the assignment.

"trainhw1.txt" and "testdatahw1.txt" are the given data sets. "bag_of_words.txt" is a text file consisting of bag of words from both data sets (created using 'create_bag_of_words.py').
